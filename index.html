                <p class="desc">
                    Welcome to the TJ Physics Olympiad! The Thomas Jefferson Physics Olympiad (TJPhO) is a free
                    annual
                    international high school competition
                    that
                    delves deep into a different, prominent applied physics problem every year. Our goal is to reach
                    aspiring
                    physicists from all over the world and introduce them to a variety of topics that will give them
                    the
                    tools
                    to tackle real-world, cutting-edge problems. In doing so, we also hope that by working through
                    the
                    exam
                    in
                    teams, students will gain valuable experience in collaboration and communication with others.
                    The deadline to register
                    is April 4th, and this
                    year’s contest will be held on April 7-10th, 2021.

                <p class="desc">
                    The topic of this year’s exam is electricity and magnetism. There are 12 free response
                    questions,
                    each which multiple subsections. Each free response question focuses on a particular topic in
                    physics related to
                    electricity and magnetism, such as circuits, conducters, and quantum mechanics, and can be
                    approached using AP Physics C
                    knowledge.
                    The
                    problem-solving process must be adequately explained, with calculations, to receive
                    full
                    credit.
                    Problems are weighted by difficulty: the test generally gets harder as it goes. We give partial
                    credit
                    on
                    every question, so feel free to put down any progress or thoughts you have so far and points
                    will be
                    awarded
                    accordingly.

                    Students will be given 4 days to complete the TJ Physics Olympiad exam, which will be located under
                    the
                    “Exam”
                    tab on test day.
                    It is recommended that participants compete in teams of three, one of whom will register their team
                    via
                    the
                    “Register” button. If you wish to be part of a 2 or 3 person team, please indicate as such in the
                    google
                    form.
                    While the exam is at the high school physics level, middle school students may also participate.

                    <br>
                    If your team has been registered, we (tjhsstphysicsteam@gmail.com) will send you a password on the
                    testing
                    date
                    in order to view the exam. The test contains background information as well as introductory,
                    intermediate,
                    and
                    advanced problems - this test is designed to be as much of a learning experience as it is a
                    competition.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Students participating in the competition may only correspond with other members of their team. No
                    other
                    correspondence is allowed, including: mentors, teachers, professors, and other students. Teams are
                    not
                    allowed
                    to use online resources or post content on online forums asking questions related to the exam. Teams
                    are
                    welcome
                    to email us if there are any questions or concerns.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For each question, you must explain how you got a particular answer even if you are not specifically
                    asked
                    to do
                    so. Partial credit will be given, so even if you are not able to solve a problem fully, show us your
                    thought
                    process and what you’ve gotten so far. Upon the conclusion of the exam, please email a pdf of your
                    team’s
                    solutions to our <a href="mailto:tjhsstphysicsteam@gmail.com" target="_blank">email.</a> The top
                    five teams will receive awards, as indicated
                    below. We
                    will
